# terminal42/contao-geoip2-country

This Contao extension finds the country from the client IP.
The website can then be customized based on this information.

This extension requires the [MaxMind GeoIP2 database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases),
either the _GeoIP2 Country_ or _GeoLite2 Country_ database. Be aware that you might
need a commercial license of this product depending on your use case!


## Features

1. **Limit content based on the user country**<br>
   By default, visibility for pages, articles, content elements and front end modules can be set for the country.
   For each content, you can either show only to or hide it from a list of countries.

2. **Symfony HTTP Reverse Proxy**<br>
   Integrated support for the Symfony HTTP Reverse Proxy allows a page to be cached
   for each country by using `Vary` headers. Without a supported reverse proxy, responses with
   country-specific content are automatically set to `Cache-Control: private`.

   This will be automatically configured for you in a Contao Managed Edition.

3. **Support for `terminal42/contao-countryselect`**<br>
   If the `countryselect` form field is added to a form, the default option is automatically
   set to the visitors country.


## Installation

Choose the installation method that matches your workflow!

### Installation via Contao Manager

Search for `terminal42/contao-geoip2-country` in the Contao Manager and add it to your installation. Finally, update the
packages.

### Manual installation

Add a composer dependency for this bundle. Therefore, change in the project root and run the following:

```bash
composer require terminal42/contao-geoip2-country
```

Depending on your environment, the command can differ, i.e. starting with `php composer.phar â€¦` if you do not have
composer installed globally.

Then, update the database via the `contao:migrate` command or the Contao install tool.

#### HTTP Reverse Proxy

If you do not use the Contao Managed Edition


## Configuration

### MaxMind GeoIP2 database

Install the binary MMDB file and configure its path in the `GEOIP2_DATABASE` environment variable
(e.g. through your `.env`/`.env.local` file).

### Bundle configuration

**Default configuration:**
```yaml
terminal42_geoip2_country:
    database_path: %env(GEOIP2_DATABASE)%
    fallback_country: XX
    dca_tables: [tl_content, tl_article, tl_module, tl_page]
```

- **database_path:** Path to the MMDB file. Defaults to the `GEOIP2_DATABASE` environment variable.
    Be aware that this setting does not apply to the HTTP Reverse Proxy!

- **fallback_country:** The default country if a visitors IP cannot be detected (e.g. applies to localhost as well).
    _XX_ is the UN standard for _unknown country_, but by entering a valid
    [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) unknown visitors might see a specific content.

- **dca_tables:** configures which elements allow the country restrictions. Changing this will add the DCA fields to the
    given table(s), but you might need to implement your own visibility checks!


## Updating the MaxMind GeoIP2 database

Detecting the country from IP requires an up-to-date information source, as
IPs change all the time. We recommend to use [MaxMind's Automatic Update Support](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoipupdate/)
to keep your database up-to-date.
